# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where certain Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly.  The problem manifests as unexpected or missing styles despite seemingly correct class usage. This could be due to a configuration error, a conflict with other CSS, or an issue within Tailwind's processing itself.  The solution involves debugging the configuration, checking for CSS conflicts, and potentially restarting the Tailwind build process to ensure that all changes are applied correctly.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install Tailwind CSS (if necessary) according to the official instructions.
3.  Observe the unexpected styling in the example HTML element.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying that the Tailwind configuration is accurate, and the build is complete and up-to-date.
